    question: "I'm a complete beginner — will this work for me?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The system is built so anyone can follow it — whether you've never run a supplement ad before or you've been buying media for years. You get the swipe file, the JSON profiles, the AI walkthroughs, and the testing framework. Just follow the steps.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already run supplement ads?",
    answer:
      "Even better. Experienced advertisers see the biggest ROI because they already know what converts — they just need a faster way to produce creatives at scale. The AI workflow will multiply your creative output overnight, so you spend less time designing and more time scaling.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from other ad spy tools?",
    answer:
      "Spy tools show you ads. Supplement Ads shows you why they work — and then helps you make your own. You're not just browsing a library. You're converting proven winners into replicable blueprints and feeding them into AI generators. It's the difference between seeing what works and actually replicating it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What supplement niches does this cover?",
    answer:
      "Every major category — protein, pre-workout, greens, nootropics, fat burners, collagen, multivitamins, gut health, sleep aids, adaptogens, and more. The swipe file is organized by niche so you can find ads in your exact category in seconds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to know how to use AI tools?",
    answer:
      "No prior AI experience needed. The walkthroughs cover everything from setting up accounts on Midjourney, DALL-E, and Flux to uploading profiles and generating creatives. You can produce your first AI-generated ad variations the same day you get access.",
  },
  {
    question: "Still thinking about it?",
    answer:
      "Consider this: every day without a creative system is another day of burned budget and stale ads. The 14-day guarantee means you risk nothing. But the cost of staying stuck — cycling through dead creatives while competitors scale — that adds up fast. If this system delivers even one winning ad, it pays for itself many times over.",
