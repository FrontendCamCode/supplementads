      And over the past several years, I've been deep in the world of supplement advertising. Studying creatives. Analyzing what converts. Figuring out what actually makes people stop scrolling and buy.

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      That's why I created Supplement Ads. It's not a course. It's not theory. It's the complete swipe file and AI creative system I use to find winning supplement ads, convert them into replicable JSON profiles, and feed them into AI image generators to produce scroll-stopping creatives on demand.

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      You'll be able to study any winning ad, break down exactly why it works, and generate new variations with AI in minutes — not days.

    <p class="text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-foreground">
      Which will free you from the creative guesswork cycle forever.
