      It wasn't until I stopped guessing at creatives...
      <span class="text-cta-yellow">
        that I started seeing real results.
      </span>
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      For years I did what every supplement advertiser does.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      I designed ads from gut instinct. Tested random angles. Spent thousands on creatives that flopped. And started the whole cycle over again.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Some campaigns crushed it. Others burned budget for nothing.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      And the cycle didn't stop... until through years of testing, analyzing hundreds of winning ads, and building an archive of what actually works... I came up with a repeatable system that worked for ANY supplement niche.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Protein. Pre-workout. Greens. Nootropics. Fat burners. It didn't matter.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      And once this clicked, I realized there's a reason the biggest supplement brands in the world — Athletic Greens, Bloom, Ryse — are able to scale their ad spend profitably.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-[#fff]">
      The difference between advertisers who win and those who don't... is a system for creative production.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Because a system lets you produce winning creatives on repeat. Which is the opposite of what most advertisers do — scrolling for inspiration, copying surface-level trends, throwing ideas at the wall, and hoping something sticks.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Maybe a few of those ads hit. But most won't. And what you're left with is a money pit of wasted ad spend, inconsistent results, and creatives that fatigue within days.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-10 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-[#fff]">
      All of that changes once you have a system. Creative production becomes as simple as plug and play.
    </p>

        THE METHOD
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-6 font-heading text-xl font-bold tracking-heading text-[#fff] md:text-2xl">
        I do one thing — and what I do is very simple:
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
        I don't design from scratch anymore. I don't scroll feeds hoping for inspiration. I don't rely on expensive creative teams.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
        Instead, I do one thing —
        <strong class="text-[#fff]">
          find proven winning supplement ads, convert them into replicable JSON profiles, and feed those profiles into AI image generators to produce high-converting creatives at scale.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
        The same process works whether you're selling protein, greens, pre-workout, or any other supplement. The system doesn't change — only the niche does.
