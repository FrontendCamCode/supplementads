      It wasn't until I stopped guessing at creatives...
      <span class="text-cta-yellow">
        that I started seeing real results.

    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      For years I did what every supplement advertiser does.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      I designed ads from gut instinct. Tested random angles. Spent thousands on creatives that flopped. And started the whole cycle over again.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Some campaigns crushed it. Others burned budget for nothing.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      And the cycle didn't stop... until through years of testing, analyzing hundreds of winning ads, and building an archive of what actually works... I came up with a repeatable system that worked for ANY supplement niche.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Protein. Pre-workout. Greens. Nootropics. Fat burners. It didn't matter.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      And once this clicked, I realized there's a reason the biggest supplement brands in the world — Athletic Greens, Bloom, Ryse — are able to scale their ad spend profitably.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-[#fff]">
      The difference between advertisers who win and those who don't... is a system for creative production.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Because a system allows you to produce winning creatives on repeat. Which is WAY different from what most advertisers are doing — guessing, copying surface-level trends, throwing stuff at the wall, and hoping something sticks.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Maybe some ads hit. But most won't. Which creates a money pit of wasted ad spend... inconsistent results... and creatives that fatigue within days.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-10 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-[#fff]">
      But all of that changes once you have a system. Creative production really does become as simple as plug and play.

        HERE'S HOW IT WORKS

      <h3 class="mb-6 font-heading text-xl font-bold tracking-heading text-[#fff] md:text-2xl">
        I do one thing well and one thing only — and what I do is very simple:
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
        I don't guess at creatives anymore. I don't scroll feeds for inspiration. I don't hire expensive design teams.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
        Instead, I focus on one thing and one thing only —
        <strong class="text-[#fff]">
          finding proven winning supplement ads, converting them to replicable JSON profiles, and feeding them into AI image generators to produce scroll-stopping creatives at scale.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
        And this works in every supplement niche. It's been done with protein powders, greens, pre-workouts, fat burners, collagen, nootropics, and dozens more. The process is one and the same, and it works no matter what.
