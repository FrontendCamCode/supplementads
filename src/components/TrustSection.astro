      The swipe file inside Supplement Ads is the result of years of collecting, analyzing, and cataloguing winning supplement ad creatives across every major category and platform.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      Every ad in the database has been vetted — real spend, real results, real conversions. Not random screenshots from ad libraries. These are the creatives that brands actually scaled with.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      And because the system is built around creative structure — not trends — it works regardless of your niche, your budget, or your market.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-[#fff]">
      I've done the hard work so you don't have to. Everything inside Supplement Ads is battle-tested and ready for you to use today.
