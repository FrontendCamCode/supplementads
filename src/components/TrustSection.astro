      And the reason I can do this...
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      ...is because I've built a database of winning supplement ad creatives over the past several years that allows you to study, replicate, and generate new creatives at scale.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      And this works in every single supplement niche. It's been done with protein, pre-workout, greens, nootropics, fat burners, collagen, multivitamins, and dozens more.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      It also works for brands spending $100/day, $1,000/day, and even $50,000/day on ads.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#999]">
      So as you can see, it doesn't matter if you're selling greens powder in Australia or nootropics in the US — the creative system is one and the same, and it works no matter what.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-[#fff]">
      Bottom line: I've done the hard work so you don't have to. Everything inside Supplement Ads is battle-tested and ready for you to use today.
