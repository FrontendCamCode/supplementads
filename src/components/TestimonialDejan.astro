      quote="I used to think I needed a full creative team to compete in supplement ads. I don't — I just needed the right system. The JSON profile workflow changed everything. I take a winning ad, convert it to a profile, tweak the angles, and let the AI generator handle the rest. Went from testing 5 creatives a week to 50. My CPAs dropped by 40% in the first month."
