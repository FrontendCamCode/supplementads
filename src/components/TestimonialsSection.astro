      "I was the typical media buyer burning out on creative production. 10-hour days making ads that died in 48 hours. The swipe file and AI workflow changed everything. I can now produce 30+ winning creative variations in an afternoon. Last month my supplement brand client scaled to $200K in ad spend profitably. This is the shortcut I wish I had years ago.",

    quote:
      "The JSON profile system alone changed everything. I was already running supplement ads but my creatives were dying after 3 days. Now I take any winning ad, convert it to a profile, and generate 20 fresh variations in minutes. My creative fatigue problem is gone and my ROAS has been consistently above 3x for the first time ever.",

    title: "Media buyer turned agency owner",
    quote:
      "I was skeptical about AI-generated ad creatives. I thought they'd look cheap and wouldn't convert. Turns out — when you feed the AI a proven winning ad structure, the output is incredible. My supplement clients are scaling faster than ever. Cam's system just works.",

    title: "E-commerce marketer, supplement niche",
    quote:
      "I spent $50 on AI credits using Cam's workflows. Generated 40 creatives in one afternoon. 3 of them became top performers that are still running profitably weeks later. I've never found winning ads this fast in 5 years of media buying. My creative pipeline is PACKED now.",
