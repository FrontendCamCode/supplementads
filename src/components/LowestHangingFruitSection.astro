    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      And I'm not the only one either — because I've taught this to hundreds of other media buyers and brand owners who are using this same method to scale their supplement ads without ever having to guess at creatives again.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      All we're doing is running a simple system that allows anyone spending $50/day to $50K/day to consistently produce winning creatives...
    </p>

    <p class="mb-10 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-foreground">
      So if you'd like to do the same, I made Supplement Ads to show you how — without guessing, without expensive creative teams, and without burning ad budget on untested ideas.
