      How come your supplement ads are <span class="text-[#e74c3c]">stuck?</span>
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      How come you're still burning through ad budget with creatives that don't convert?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      How come you spend days designing a single ad only for it to flop in the first 48 hours?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      And most importantly, how come other supplement brands are scaling to $50K, $100K, even $500K months while your ad account is stuck in a death spiral?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      After all, there are plenty of supplement advertisers out there printing money... and it's actually <em>easy</em> for them.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      And it has nothing to do with having a better product. Or a bigger budget. Or a fancier design team.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-foreground">
      It has everything to do with the creative system you're running.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-6 font-heading text-xl font-bold tracking-heading text-foreground">
      Here are the 3 things holding you back:
    </h3>

    <ul class="mb-8 flex flex-col gap-4">
      <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
        <div class="mt-1 flex h-6 w-6 flex-shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-[#e74c3c]">
          <svg class="h-3.5 w-3.5 text-[#fff]" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">

          </svg>
        </div>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
          <strong class="text-foreground">You design every ad from scratch</strong> — spending days on custom creatives when you could be reverse-engineering proven winners and generating variations with AI in minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
        <div class="mt-1 flex h-6 w-6 flex-shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-[#e74c3c]">
          <svg class="h-3.5 w-3.5 text-[#fff]" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">

          </svg>
        </div>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
          <strong class="text-foreground">You have no system for studying competitors</strong> — scrolling through feeds hoping to spot a winning ad, when you could have a curated swipe file of hundreds of proven supplement creatives organized by niche, format, and angle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="flex items-start gap-3">
        <div class="mt-1 flex h-6 w-6 flex-shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-[#e74c3c]">
          <svg class="h-3.5 w-3.5 text-[#fff]" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">

          </svg>
        </div>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
          <strong class="text-foreground">You're not using AI to scale creative output</strong> — manually designing one ad at a time when AI image generators can produce dozens of high-converting variations from a single winning ad profile in minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#333]">
      Now you can see why some supplement brands crush it while most don't.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-bold leading-relaxed text-foreground">
      The ones making real money have a system for finding winners, breaking them down, and producing new creatives at scale. And because they do that, they dominate every ad platform — and you get left behind.
